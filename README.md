# Credit Risk Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of credit risk using the [Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranadeep/credit-risk-dataset). The project focuses on data exploration, cleaning, and visual analysis to understand the factors contributing to credit risk.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Modify and create new features for better analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights through detailed visualization and statistical methods.
- **Risk Categorization**: Analyze and categorize credit risks based on given features.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For development and documentation.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is available on Kaggle:
[Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranadeep/credit-risk-dataset)


## Future Work
- Extend the project to include machine learning models for predicting `Loan_Status`.
- Perform a deeper analysis using advanced statistical techniques.
